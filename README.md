# FEM Thermal Analysis for 2D Square Conduction

This project applies the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** to solve **steady-state heat conduction** problems in a 2D square domain using **Python**.  
It models the temperature distribution across a square plate by incorporating boundary conditions and various levels of mesh refinement for improved accuracy.

## üß© Components

### **1. 2D Heat Transfer in a Square Domain**
- Simulates heat conduction in a square region using **triangular elements**.  
- Implements **Dirichlet boundary conditions** (fixed temperatures) on the square edges.  
- Solves for **temperature distribution** under both uniform and non-uniform heat sources.

---

### **2. Mesh and Elements**
- The domain is discretized using **triangular elements**, with each node representing a temperature point.  
- **Mesh refinement** is applied using a **dichotomy algorithm**, subdividing triangles to increase accuracy.  
- The refined mesh results in a more precise temperature profile but increases computation time.

---

### **3. Thermal Resistance Analysis**
- **Thermal resistance** is computed from the temperature distribution.  
- Results show how increasing mesh density improves solution accuracy while raising computational cost.

---

### **4. Python Implementation**
- Built with **NumPy** and **SciPy** for numerical computation.  
- **Matplotlib** is used for temperature distribution visualization.  
- The algorithm assembles the **global stiffness matrix** and **force vector**, applying boundary conditions and heat source terms.

### **5. Customizable Parameters**
The simulation offers several parameters that can be modified to explore different thermal behaviors:

- **Heat Source:** Can be included or excluded to observe the effect of internal heat generation.  
- **Mesh Refinement:** The level of mesh refinement can be adjusted for higher accuracy.  
- **Convection:** Optional convection boundary conditions simulate heat exchange with the surrounding environment.  
- **Thermal Conductivity & Source Term:** Both thermal conductivity and internal heat source can be varied to analyze their impact on the temperature distribution.
