# FEM-Thermal-Heat-Transfer
This project implements Finite Element Method (FEM) in Python to solve steady-state heat conduction problems in both 1D and 2D domains. The 1D case models heat transfer in a beam, while the 2D case analyzes temperature distribution in square and L-shaped domains using triangular elements.
